  I found this cool flowchart (https://algo.monster/flowchart) which lets you figure out which algorithm should you use (not an exhaustive list) for most common DSA questions asked. However I had trouble scrolling through the chart so I made this small Yes / No application to do the same thing [things you can do when you're an engineer ðŸ˜Ž] Have fun exploring!
